## üìà Trading Strategy

### Market Regime Classification

The system identifies 7 distinct market regimes:

| Regime ID | Name | Strategy | Expected Value | Win Rate | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| 0 | STABLE_GROWTH | Conservative | 1.156R | 35.6% | ‚ùå Eliminated |
| 1 | MODERATE_MOMENTUM | Momentum | 0.923R | 78% | ‚úÖ Active |
| 2 | BASELINE_MARKET | Balanced | 3.305R | 93% | ‚úÖ **Top Performer** |
| 3 | EXTREME_OUTLIER | Wait & See | -0.421R | 60% | ‚ùå Eliminated |
| 4 | DEFENSIVE_STABLE | Conservative | -0.668R | 16.7% | ‚ùå Eliminated |
| 5 | BREAKOUT_MOMENTUM | Momentum | 2.173R | 76% | ‚úÖ Active |
| 6 | EXTREME_VOLATILITY | Wait & See | -0.891R | 3.3% | ‚ùå Eliminated |

### Expected Value Optimization

The strategy focuses exclusively on **positive EV regimes**:
- **BALANCED (Regime 2)**: 45% allocation - Best performer with 3.305R EV
- **MOMENTUM (Regimes 1&5)**: 55% allocation - Combined strong performance

### Position Sizing Algorithm

```python
# Enhanced position sizing with multiple factors
position_size = base_allocation √ó volatility_adjustment √ó persistence_bonus √ó coin_score √ó concentration_limit

# Where:
# - base_allocation: Regime-specific percentage (45% BALANCED, 55% MOMENTUM)
# - volatility_adjustment: Dynamic based on PC2 volatility factor
# - persistence_bonus: Increased size for stable regimes
# - coin_score: PC-factor based cryptocurrency attractiveness
# - concentration_limit: Portfolio risk management constraint
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Limitations

### Data Constraints
- **CoinGecko API Limit**: Free tier restricts historical data to **1 year maximum** (365 days)
- **Limited Cryptocurrency Coverage**: Analysis focuses on 15 major cryptocurrencies
- **Data Frequency**: Daily data only - no intraday high-frequency analysis
- **API Rate Limits**: 10-50 calls per minute depending on endpoint

### Backtesting Limitations
- **No Transaction Costs**: Backtesting assumes zero fees, spreads, or slippage
- **Perfect Execution**: Assumes all orders fill at exact target prices
- **Liquidity Assumptions**: No modeling of market impact or liquidity constraints
- **Survivorship Bias**: Only includes cryptocurrencies that existed throughout the period

### Technical Constraints
- **Paper Trading Only**: C++ system uses Alpaca paper trading (no real capital at risk)
- **Regime Stability**: Requires 30+ days of data for reliable regime classification
- **Feature Dependencies**: 988 features may be sensitive to data quality issues
- **Real-time Lag**: 15-minute delay between regime detection and trading decisions

### Market Limitations
- **Regime Persistence**: Strategy assumes regimes persist long enough for profitable trades
- **Market Structure**: Doesn't account for crypto-specific factors (staking, DeFi, etc.)
- **Correlation Assumptions**: PC analysis may break down during extreme market events
- **Time Period**: Backtesting limited to 2024-2025 bull market conditions

### System Dependencies
- **External APIs**: Relies on CoinGecko and Alpaca API availability
- **Internet Connection**: Requires stable connection for real-time data
- **Computational Requirements**: PCA and clustering analysis needs adequate memory/CPU

### Research Evolution Limitations
- **Initial Research Approach**: The project began with comprehensive PCA analysis that revealed 4 natural market regimes, but the trading system was built around a 7-regime framework before this insight was gained
- **Architecture Mismatch**: Trading strategy and backtesting systems use 7-regime classification while research notebooks show optimal 4-regime clustering
- **Documentation Inconsistency**: Some analysis sections reflect the improved 4-regime understanding while the production system maintains the original 7-regime structure
- **Future Alignment**: A complete system refactor to align with 4-regime findings would improve performance and interpretability

## üöÄ Future Improvements

**With Enhanced Data Access:**
- **Multi-Year Analysis**: 3-5 years of data for more robust regime detection
- **Higher Frequency**: Hourly/minute-level data for intraday strategies
- **Additional Assets**: Extended crypto universe (100+ cryptocurrencies)
- **Alternative Data**: Social sentiment, on-chain metrics, DeFi yields

**Advanced Features:**
- **Transaction Cost Modeling**: Realistic fees, spreads, and slippage
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Modern Portfolio Theory integration
- **Risk Attribution**: Factor-based risk decomposition
- **Live Trading**: Real capital deployment with proper risk controls

## üö® Risk Disclaimers

- **Educational Purpose**: This system is designed for research and learning only
- **Not Financial Advice**: Past performance does not guarantee future results
- **Market Risk**: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and risky
- **Capital Risk**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- **Backtesting Bias**: Historical results may not reflect live trading performance
