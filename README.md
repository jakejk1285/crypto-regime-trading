## üìà Trading Strategy

### Market Regime Classification

The system identifies 7 distinct market regimes with **performance-optimized allocation**:

| Regime ID | Name | Strategy | Actual Performance | Allocation | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------------|------------|---------|
| 0 | BULL_MOMENTUM | Aggressive | 55.6% WR, $839 avg P&L | 35% | üöÄ **Top Performer** |
| 1 | SHARP_CORRECTION | Defensive | 44.0% WR, -$59 avg P&L | 5% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal |
| 2 | SIDEWAYS_MARKET | Balanced | 40.0% WR, -$264 avg P&L | 5% | ‚ùå Avoided |
| 3 | WAIT_AND_SEE | None | N/A | 0% | üö´ Eliminated |
| 4 | CONSERVATIVE | Moderate | 52.9% WR, $540 avg P&L | 25% | ‚úÖ Strong |
| 5 | VOLATILE_REBOUND | Selective | 57.7% WR, $87 avg P&L | 12% | ‚ö° Limited |
| 6 | EXTREME_VOLATILITY | None | N/A | 0% | üö´ Eliminated |

### Performance-Based Optimization

The strategy **dynamically allocates** based on actual backtest performance:
- **BULL_MOMENTUM (Regime 0)**: 35% allocation - Highest average P&L per trade
- **CONSERVATIVE (Regime 4)**: 25% allocation - Strong consistent performer
- **VOLATILE_REBOUND (Regime 5)**: 12% allocation - Good win rate but low average P&L
- **Losing regimes**: 5% or 0% allocation - Capital protection

### Enhanced Position Sizing Algorithm

```python
# Multi-factor position sizing with EV optimization and PC factor strength
position_size = ev_base_allocation √ó pc_strength_multiplier √ó persistence_bonus √ó coin_score √ó risk_limits

# Key Components:
# - EV-based allocation: Data-driven regime allocation (35%-0.5% based on Expected Value)
# - PC factor strength: PC1/PC2/PC3 signal strength (0.7x - 1.4x optimized range)
# - Volatility controls: Enhanced risk management for Sharpe optimization

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Project Limitations

### Data Constraints
- **CoinGecko API Limit**: Free tier restricts historical data to **1 year maximum** (365 days)
- **Limited Cryptocurrency Coverage**: Analysis focuses on 15 major cryptocurrencies
- **Data Frequency**: Daily data only - no intraday high-frequency analysis
- **API Rate Limits**: 10-50 calls per minute depending on endpoint

### Backtesting Limitations
- **No Transaction Costs**: Backtesting assumes zero fees, spreads, or slippage
- **Perfect Execution**: Assumes all orders fill at exact target prices
- **Liquidity Assumptions**: No modeling of market impact or liquidity constraints
- **Survivorship Bias**: Only includes cryptocurrencies that existed throughout the period

### Technical Constraints
- **Paper Trading Only**: C++ system uses Alpaca paper trading (no real capital at risk)
- **Regime Stability**: Requires 30+ days of data for reliable regime classification
- **Feature Dependencies**: 988 features may be sensitive to data quality issues
- **Real-time Lag**: 15-minute delay between regime detection and trading decisions

### Market Limitations
- **Regime Persistence**: Strategy assumes regimes persist long enough for profitable trades
- **Market Structure**: Doesn't account for crypto-specific factors (staking, DeFi, etc.)
- **Correlation Assumptions**: PC analysis may break down during extreme market events
- **Time Period**: Backtesting limited to 2024-2025 bull market conditions

### System Dependencies
- **External APIs**: Relies on CoinGecko and Alpaca API availability
- **Internet Connection**: Requires stable connection for real-time data
- **Computational Requirements**: PCA and clustering analysis needs adequate memory/CPU

### Research Framework Limitations
- **Regime Classification**: System uses 7-regime framework optimized for comprehensive market coverage
- **Data-Driven Design**: Performance optimization balances regime granularity with practical trading effectiveness
- **Implementation Consistency**: Trading strategy and backtesting systems aligned on performance-tested 7-regime structure
- **Analytical Framework**: Current architecture optimized for real-world trading performance over theoretical clustering

## üöÄ Future Improvements

**With Enhanced Data Access:**
- **Multi-Year Analysis**: 3-5 years of data for more robust regime detection
- **Higher Frequency**: Hourly/minute-level data for intraday strategies
- **Additional Assets**: Extended crypto universe (100+ cryptocurrencies)

- **Risk Attribution**: Factor-based risk decomposition
- **Live Trading**: Real capital deployment with proper risk controls

## üö® Risk Disclaimers

- **Educational Purpose**: This system is designed for research and learning only
- **Not Financial Advice**: Past performance does not guarantee future results
- **Market Risk**: Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and risky
- **Capital Risk**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
- **Backtesting Bias**: Historical results may not reflect live trading performance
